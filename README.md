# WordPress Blueprint

ðŸš§ This is a work in progress.

A [blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code) can be used to automatically set up WordPress at a place like [Render](https://render.com/).

This is used together with a [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/wordpress-content-example) that has the WordPress files, uploads and a MySQL backup file.
